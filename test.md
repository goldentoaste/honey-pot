## How to code python 101
---
here we go now!
```py
# here are some python code
from os import path
import requests
from multiprocessing import ThreadPool

# first define a function
def stuff():
	x = doStuff()

	for i in range(19):
		try: 
			print(x[i])
		except IndexError as e:
			print(f"i is out of bound. i: {i}")
```

* remeber to never let i go out of bound!
	+ but if you do, at least write a try except.  

*thats all for now!*
