## How to code python 101
---
here we go now!
```text
# here are some python code
from os import path
import requests
from multiprocessing import ThreadPool

# first define a function
def stuff():
	x = doStuff()

	for i in range(19):
		try: 
			print(x[i])
		except IndexError as e:
			print(f"i is out of bound. i: {i}")

# lets write a class!
class Weeo(object):
	def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
		self.stuff1 = arg1
		self.stuff2 = arg2
```

* remeber to never let i go out of bound!
	+ but if you do, at least write a try except.  

*thats all for now!!*
